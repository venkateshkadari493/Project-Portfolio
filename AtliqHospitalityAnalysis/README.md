                                                                   Introduction:
AtliQ Grands is a highly respected name in hospitality, known for its outstanding 20-year history. They have a strong presence in major Indian cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad and own a group of top-notch five-star hotels. They are dedicated to providing excellent service and luxurious accommodations.
                                                                    
                                                                    
                                                                    Objective: 
AtliQ Grands a company known for it's luxury and business hotels has been losing it's market share and revenue due to competition and poor management decisions.
To bounce back the managing director decided to onboard a Business and Data Intelligence Team as the company lacked an in-house Data Analyst. So here we need to assume ourselves as Data Analysts and present the insights to the company.This project can help the company to look-in the areas where they need to concentrate for more profits.
